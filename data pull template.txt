## **Instructions for Use**
- Copy the relevant template above.
- Paste it into a new file in `data/fetched_samples/` (e.g., `MYTICKER_raw_is.csv`).
- Fill in or replace the numbers as needed for your test case.
- For the CSVs, ensure the first row is the header (with years), and the first column is the line item name.
- For the JSON, ensure it is valid JSON format.

**You can create as many sets as you want for different tickers or scenarios (e.g., `AAPL_raw_is.csv`, `AAPL_raw_bs.csv`, etc.).**

Let me know if you want a template for a specific scenario (e.g., with duplicate rows, missing data, etc.)!
