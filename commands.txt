Here’s a refined, step-by-step guide for running the Bruce Greenwald EPV Valuation Model on any sample data in the future:

---

## 1. Prepare Your Sample Data

Place your sample files in the following directory:
```
data/fetched_samples/
```
You need these four files for each ticker (replace `TICKER` with your symbol, e.g., `AAPL`):
- `TICKER_raw_is.csv`    # Income Statement
- `TICKER_raw_bs.csv`    # Balance Sheet
- `TICKER_raw_cf.csv`    # Cash Flow Statement
- `TICKER_raw_info.json`  # Company Info

---

## 2. Open a Terminal and Navigate to the Project Root

```sh
cd "/Users/benjaminwilliams/Bruce Greenwald EPV Valuation Model"
```

---

## 3. Run the Model Using Your Sample Data

Use the following command, replacing `TICKER` with your desired symbol (e.g., `AAPL`):

```sh
python3 -m epv_valuation_model.main --use-sample-data TICKER
```

**Example for AAPL:**
```sh
python3 -m epv_valuation_model.main --use-sample-data AAPL
```

---

## 4. (Optional) View Help/Usage

To see all available command-line options:

```sh
python3 -m epv_valuation_model.main --help
```

---

## 5. Interpreting Output

- The script will print a detailed valuation summary, including:
  - Normalized EBIT
  - Maintenance Capex
  - NOPAT
  - WACC
  - EPV (Operations & Equity)
  - Asset Value (Equity Proxy)
  - Margin of Safety
  - Recommendation (Buy/Hold/Sell)
- All calculations are based on your sample data files.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package**  
  Always use the `-m` flag as shown above to run the script as a module.
- **File Not Found**  
  Ensure your sample files are named and placed exactly as described in step 1.

---

## 7. Updating or Adding New Tickers

- Simply add new sets of files (e.g., `MSFT_raw_is.csv`, etc.) to `data/fetched_samples/`.
- Run the model with the new ticker symbol as shown in step 3.
